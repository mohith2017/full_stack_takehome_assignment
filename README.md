### **Take-Home Assignment: Data Review, Editor, and Exporter**

**Objective**: Build a data review interface that queries JSON data from a Next.js API, displays the data in a table format with validation errors, and allows users to export the data in CSV format. You will also color-code validation errors and provide error details in an interactive way.

**Deliverables**:

1. **Data Query from API**: Implement a Next.js API route that returns the provided mock JSON data (attached below).
2. **Data Review Table**:
    - Display the data in a table, flattening any nested fields (e.g., `address`) into separate columns (e.g., `Street`, `City`, `Zipcode`).
    - Color-code validation errors in each column according to severity:
        - Red for critical errors (must be fixed).
        - Yellow for warnings (should be reviewed).
        - Green for valid fields.
    - **Hoverable Error Messages**: Each cell with a validation error should display the error message on hover as a tooltip.
    - **Error Summary Modal**: Include an "Error Summary" modal with a clickable button or link that opens a modal. This modal should list all the validation errors for that specific row, with details for each error.
3. **CSV Export**: Allow users to export the data to a CSV format.

# Approach

## Project Setup

- Used Next.js with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implemented Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up ESLint for code quality

## Architecture

- Created API route /api/data to serve the mock JSON data
- Built reusable components for:
    - Data table with sortable columns
    - Error tooltips
    - Error summary modal
    - CSV export functionality

## Data Flow

- Fetch data from API on component mount
- Transform nested data into flattened table structure
- Handle error states and loading states
- Implement client-side sorting and filtering

## Assumptions

- Data Structure
    - The JSON data structure will remain consistent with the provided mock data
    - All records will have the same fields (id, name, email, etc.)
    - Error objects will always have message and severity properties

- User Experience
    - Users need to see all data at once (no pagination required for MVP)
    - Color coding should be consistent:
        - Red: critical errors
        - Yellow: warnings
        - Green: valid fields
    - Hoverable tooltips are sufficient for quick error checks
    - Modal is needed for detailed error review

## Future Improvements

- Performance Optimizations
    - Implement server-side pagination for large datasets
    - Add client-side caching
    - Optimize re-renders using React.memo and useMemo

- Enhanced Features
    - Add column filtering and search functionality
    - Implement row selection for bulk actions
    - Add ability to edit data directly in the table
    - Provide different export formats (Excel, JSON)
    - Add keyboard navigation support

- UI/UX Enhancements
    - Add loading skeletons
    - Implement responsive design for mobile devices
    - Add dark mode support
    - Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
    - Add animations for modal and tooltip interactions

- Testing
    - Add unit tests for components
    - Add integration tests for API
    - Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
    - Implement error boundary for better error handling

- Documentation
    - Add JSDoc comments for components
    - Create Storybook documentation
    - Add API documentation
    - Include setup instructions for local development


**Design Considerations**:

- **No Figma Provided**: We have deliberately not provided Figma or design assets for this project. This is to give you the freedom to design the table and modals as you see fit. Part of the evaluation will be based on your ability to create a user-friendly, intuitive UI without strict design guidelines. You're free to choose the best layout, color schemes, and UX patterns, and UI Libraries that fit the task.


**Mock Data**: You will be working with the following mock JSON data. The data will always follow a static model. Your API should serve this data to the frontend:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York",
      "zipcode": "12345",
      "phone": "123-456-7890",
      "status": "active",
      "errors": {
        "phone": {
          "message": "Invalid phone format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Invalid zipcode",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@sample",
      "street": "456 Elm St",
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "zipcode": "",
      "phone": "987-654-3210",
      "status": "inactive",
      "errors": {
        "email": {
          "message": "Invalid email format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Zipcode is missing",
          "severity": "critical"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
      "street": "",
      "city": "Chicago",
      "zipcode": "60614",
      "phone": "111-222-3333",
      "status": "pending",
      "errors": {
        "street": {
          "message": "Street address is missing",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

**Expectations**:

- **Tech Stack**: Use **Next.js** for API and server-side rendering, React for frontend components. Styling can be done with **Tailwind CSS** or your **UI library of choice**.
- **Time Estimation**: This assignment should take 4â€“6 hours to complete.
- **Submission**: Please fork this repo, and provide a GitHub repo link containing your code, with a README explaining your approach, assumptions, and any improvements you would make given more time.
